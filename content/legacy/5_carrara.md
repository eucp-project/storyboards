## Carrara, Italy, in September 2003

This HP and flash flood event is summarized on Italian Wikipedia:
https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvione_di_Carrara_del_2003. The region was
affected by torrential rain: ”in about two and a half hours 200 mm of rain was
falling”. It may as well be described as a landfalling event, hot and humid air
from the Mediterranean sea, the tense south-western flow and the orography of
upper Tuscany, were among the triggers that played a major role.

The tracker identifies the event and attributes fitting properties: It is
short-lived, of small scale and intense. Also in a cpRCM such events may be
well-represented.
