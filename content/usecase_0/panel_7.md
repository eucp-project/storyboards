## General conclusions

Our findings lead to the general conclusions:

- Initialized decadal predictions hold promise in predicting drought and heat stress conditions on a multi-annual timescale.
- Positive probabilistic skill is found for SPEI6 and HMDI3 index, particularly over Europe and the Middle Eastern countries during the wheat harvest months.
- Calibration of the indices improves the skill over several regions, which presents high negative values.
- Using Attributes (or Reliability) Diagrams, it is evident that Calibration (or bias adjustment) of the index is essential for providing trustworthy and robust forecasts to the interested end users in the agricultural sector.
