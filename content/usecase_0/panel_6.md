## Decadal prediction for wheat sector

Here is another illustration of a potential climate service product for the wheat sector based on categorical events.

Jesi is one of the identified regions by the stakeholders in the EU H2020-MED-GOLD project to be among the leading regions used for the production of durum wheat in Italy.

This figure shows time series of multi-year averaged SPEI6 (top) and HMDI3 (bottom) over Jesi, Italy (43.82° N, 13.75° E). The small (large) gray dots correspond to the ensemble members of the hindcasts (ensemble members mean) for each start date. The black dots correspond to the observed values. The brown (blue) and green (red) horizontal lines show its lower and upper observed terciles of SPEI6 (HMDI3), respectively.
