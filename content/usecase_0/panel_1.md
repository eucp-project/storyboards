## Introduction and Aim

Wheat sector is heavily influenced by recent alterations in the frequency and severity of extreme climate events. There is a growing need of climate information for effective planning and adaptive actions to the near-term climate variability and change.

The aim is to assess the forecast quality in predicting the evolution of multi-year drought and heat stress conditions by using user-relevant agro-climatic index over global wheat growing region. The considered agro-climatic index includes Standardized Potential Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)  and Heat Magnitude Day Index (HMDI).

## Wheat harvest months
The harvested month is retrieved from the MIRCA2000 dataset. For each grid box, the forecast quality evaluation of initialized decadal prediction is carried-out for the months preceding the harvest of wheat on a global spatial scale and therefore the presented results in this evaluation will correspond to different times of the year for different regions.
