## Data and Methods

Datasets used in this project are:

- NCAR Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (DPLE): Forecasts that were run by explicitly prescribing the contemporaneous state of the climate system at the start of the simulation annually.
- Observational reference: JRA-55 for monthly mean temperature and GPCCv2018 for precipitation.

Methodology is described in the figure.
