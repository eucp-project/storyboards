## Introduction and Aim: EUCP data

### WP3 simulations with high-resolution convection-permitting regional climate models​

  - Better representation of extreme rainfall (Ban et al., 2021)​
  - Heavy to severe rainfall would happen more often in the future (Pichelli et
    al., 2021)​

### So what would this mean?

  Translate high-resolution convection-permitting climate models to hydrological
  impacts​
