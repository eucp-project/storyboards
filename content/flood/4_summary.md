## Take home messages

- The Harmonie CP NWP model can capture the nature of the extreme Copenhagen event of July 2, 2011
- While it is not necessarily possible to accurately simulate the Copenhagen extreme event, it is possible to identify its risk using an ensemble approach.
- The risk of achieving precipitation amounts such as those observed increases with global warming.
- The risk of achieving even more intense precipitation rates over the affected region increases.
