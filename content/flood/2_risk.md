## Risk assessment

Simulating intense convective storm is very challenging due, among other things, their very high sensitivities to initial conditions the difficulty of the models to resolve small-scale interactions. Here, we use a sophisticated ensemble approach with the HARMONIE-AROME limited-area numerical weather prediction model was able to represent the event. 

The figure shows the hourly precipitation at 16 UTC for all members (a,d-o), the risk (b) using a threshold of 60 mm/h and the associated ensemble mean (c) for the control ensemble for July 2, 2011. The red star indicates the location of Copenhagen.
