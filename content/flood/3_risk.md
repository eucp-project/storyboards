## Risk assessment

Our approach shows that we have been able to catch the main caracteristique of the storm and then his related risk. The next question was trying to understand the influence over the event from the observed and upcoming warming. 

Using an adapted pseudo-global warming approach, we investigate the related risk of the same event using conditions mimicking pre-industrial period.  

Using the same an adapted pseudo-global warming approach, we also investigate the related risk of the same event using conditions mimicking different warming levels.  

The figure shows the upscaled hourly probability maps from 15 UTC to 20 UTC for all climate targets (-1째C, control, +1째C, +2째C and +3째C respectively). Threshold : 60 mm/h.
