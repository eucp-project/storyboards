## Benefits and added value of convection-permitting climate modeling over Fenno-Scandinavia

Snow, ice, the long coastline, and the Scandes mountains, they all make the Fenno-Scandinavia a complex region. The box plots show observed distribution of daily mean T2m (top panel) and Pr (bottom) for DJF (left half) and JJA (right half) seasons. 

## A mini-ensemble

A mini-ensemble is used to explore the climate in this region. The modelling region is illustrated in the left figure and the configuration is listed below:
- HCLIM-ALADIN @ 12km resolution, HCLIM-AROME @ 3km
- ERA-I driven runs; 1998–2018
- GCM driven runs; 1985–2005 / 2040–2060 / 2080–2100
- 2 forcing GCMs: EC-Earth & GFDL-CM3 (CMIP5)
- 2 emission scenarios: RCP8.5 and RCP4.5
