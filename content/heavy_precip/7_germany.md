## Western Germany, 2016/05/26-2016/06/09

A stationary synoptic weather pattern, characterized by a ridge stretching from
Great Britain to Scandinavia, caused a blocking situation. The pressure gradient
and the resulting wind speed in the lower troposphere were very weak.
Consequently, thunderstorms were almost stationary, resulting in large
precipitation accumulations in local areas.

The tracker identifies a multitude of precipitation events in the observations.
