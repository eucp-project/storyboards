## Gard, France, in September 2002


This event is documented in detail by [Delrieu et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-400.1). A landfalling mesoscale convective system remained stationary for almost two days, trapped by the orography. It brough horrendous amounts of rainfall and caused wide-spread flooding.

It is well-represented in the observational dataset. Our tracker identifies it and describes it correctly with a duration of 32 hours, a high intensity and a large scale and total precipitation amount. Also in a cpRCM such events are represented.
