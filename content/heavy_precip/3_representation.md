## Representation of precipitation extremes

Regional Climate Models integrated on convection permitting grids (dx<=4km; cpRCMs) improve the representation of precipitation extremes, as shown by [Pichelli et al. (2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-021-05657-4), e.g. in their Figure 3. However, information about the properties of the events, causing these extremes, is not yielded.
