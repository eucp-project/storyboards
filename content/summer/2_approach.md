## The idea behind this study

The struggle of climate models to predict unforced decadal variations of temperature over continents is well-documented. Skilful dynamical model predictions for unforced variations are mostly reported for oceanic properties such as heat content or sea surface temperature (SST). Our idea: identify an observed (statistical) connection between the dynamically predictable ocean and dynamically unpredictable EUST to provide skilful dynamical-statistical decadal prediction of unforced EUST. Such a dyn-stat prediction would rely on skilful decadal unforced SST prediction to infer statistically EUST predictions using SST-EUST pathways.

## The residuals approach
These investigations require an estimate of observed unforced variability. This variability is difficult to estimate. One approach is to construct the mean of historical model simulations with global climate models. These are different except in their external forcing. Their mean can separate the response of the climate system to forcing, so the forced response can be subtracted from the observed climate signal. This residuals method was introduced by Smith et al. (2019). Here, we use it for the first time to also examine unforced interactions in the climate system. We construct the residuals from an average over 28 different climate models with a total of more than 250 simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP 6).
