## Dynamical-statistical predictions of unforced EUST

In our framework, a prediction of unforced EUST is constructed from a dynamical prediction of unforced spring ENAMED SST, which is then rescaled based on the local historically observed summer temperature variance at each grid point. Such predictions outperform purely dynamical predictions over most of southern Europe, leading to significant prediction skill. In some areas, the skill increase is even significant. 
Our findings highlight the value of using the skill of dynamical decadal ocean predictions to harvest skill for the unforced signal of EUST variations 2-9 years ahead.
