## Data availability

We have gone to great lengths to provide the data from different methods in a
standardized format. Where possible, we followed CMOR standards and
CF-conventions.

The data is available through Zenodo and can be cited using the information
provided there. Its DOI is
[10.5281/zenodo.5645153](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5645153)
