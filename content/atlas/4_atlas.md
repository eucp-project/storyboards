## Atlas of (un)constrained projections

Given the added skill in these methods, we have been working to make this data
more widely available.

The [EUCP Atlas](https://eucp-project.github.io/atlas/) provides a portal for
preprocessed projections for Europe. It allows exploration of the different
methods, comparison betweem multiple views, and answers to frequently asked
questions.

The Atlas has its own DOI:
[10.5281/zenodo.5654741](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5654741). Source code is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/eucp-project/atlas/).
