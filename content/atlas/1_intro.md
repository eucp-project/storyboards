## Observationally constrained projections gaining greater visibility

Observational constraints used in IPCC to provide context, given many more high
temperature response simulations that are not thought to be more likely.

> For the first time in an IPCC report, assessed future changes in global
> surface temperature, ocean warming and sea level are constructed by combining
> multi-model projections with observational constraints based on past simulated
> warming, as well as the AR6 assessment of climate sensitivity.
