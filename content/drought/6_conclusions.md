## Conclusions

- The large ensemble storyline method works. It allows to create analogues of
  observed events in future warmer climates. 
- The ensemble data set has to be quite bit, this is necessary to find the right
  balance between analogue composite size (to decrease influence of natural
  variability, noise) and analogue return period (to sample an appropriate
  extreme event).
