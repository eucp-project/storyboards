## Data and Methods​

Datasets used in this project are:​

- Mast stations​
- ERA5 forecast dataset​: 
  - 10m wind speed (w10), w100, 2m temperature (t2m), 850hPa temperature (850t)​
- Model simulation​:
  - 10 models from EURO-CORDEX ensemble, variables including: w10, t2m, 850t. Machine Learning method was used to get the w100 from 10 model ensembles.​

**Load factor** - the ratio of average electrical power to the rated electrical power, is used to characterize wind energy.
