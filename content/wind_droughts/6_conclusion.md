## General conclusion

- Whole Europe​:

Low wind energy winter in Europe is expected to become more common in a warming
world. The return period of 11 years return period events have been shortened to
about 10 years in the whole Europe and it would be shortened to about 7 years
during 2041-2070 under RCP 8.5 scenarios. ​

- Regional differences: ​

Low wind energy winter are becoming more common in most countries from the past
to the current, and it will become more frequent in the future, particularly in
northern countries, which would have a negative impact on the development of
wind power generation in these regions. ​
