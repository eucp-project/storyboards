## Introduction

The decline of wind speed in some regions of the world is expected to decrease wind power production. ​

As the occurrence of wind drought receives increasing attention, two questions should be discussed. ​

1. Will the decrease in wind energy resources continue in the future?​
2. Are the current “wind energy drought” caused by climate change?​

**Aim**: Systematic attribution work of wind power production in Europe.​
