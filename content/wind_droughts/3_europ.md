## Wind drought in the Whole Europe​

The figure shows the changes in return periods and return values for 10 model
ensembles in three different periods.​

-> Previous:1971-2000​

-> Current: 2000-2029​

-> Future: 2041-2069​

**For Whole Europe**, the low wind energy winter becomes more frequent in the
recent year and the increase will be continue in the future. During 2041-2070,
the risk ratio is about 1.52, which implies that the probability that the load
factor is lower than the threshold would be increased in the future climate, and
it would be more than 1.52 times as much as that in the current climate.​

**In Britanny**, changes of wind energy drought are not significant during three different periods.​
