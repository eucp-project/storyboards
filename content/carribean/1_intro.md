## Caribbean

Many of the regional climate simulations carried out as part of EUCP were situated over Europe. On explicit request by the EU, EUCP also conducted a limited number of simulations with very high resolution regional climate models for a number outer-European domains. One of the domains is the Caribbean, known for its sunshine and sandy beaches, but also for devastating tropical cyclones, monster waves and coastal erosion.
