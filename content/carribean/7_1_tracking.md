## Poor man's tracking
As a second example we count the number of hours with hurricane-force windspeeds in each of the models in the 2017 hurricane season. This could be considered as a poor manâ€™s tracking approach. Although most models resolve the TC from 2017, there is still some model spread (remember the lateral forcing is all identical). 

Note that the models labelled SMHI and KNMI are identical (HCLIM-AROME), but that KNMI uses RACMO as the intermediate model, which SMHI uses a direct approach. [SMHI and DMI are also the same model, but their resolutions differ]. Track coherence seems weakest in GERICS (REMO-NH model).
