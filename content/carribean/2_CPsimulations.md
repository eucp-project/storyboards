## Convection permitting (CP) simulations

The research question addressed here is what very high resoution CPM simulations could add to the story of climate change in the region, with a special interest in the wind and precipitation characteristics of tropical cyclones. Additionally, it could perhaps be used to apply methodology derived primarily for the European domains, to these other domains. Two other sets of outer-European CPM simulations were created within EUCP: one for Madeira, and one for the island of La RÃ©union. These are not discussed in this presentation.
