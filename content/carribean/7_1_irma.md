## First results
First result is of Irma, the big TC of 2017. Shown is the simulation of the hourly windfield. The black line is the observed track from the IBTrACS database. As you can see the TC is well resolved (clear eye formation) and follows the observed track rather accurately, making it quite suitable for impact studies in e.g. WP4. At the end of the simulation period, the next TC (Jose) is just appearing.
