## Precipitation
A first glance at the changes in precipitation can be obtained from histograms of the hourly spatial maximum of the precipitation field, aggregated over all hours and all years. By looking at the field-maximum we thus discard information on the size of events. Furthermore, only sea area is considered here. There are substantial differences between the models yet all show unmistakably a tendency towards higher maxima in future. A more complete analysis of the distribution, that includes the size of events is in preparation.
