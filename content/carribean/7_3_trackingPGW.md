## Poor man's tracking with PGW perturbations added
In the second experiment, the same seasons were simulated with PGW perturbations added. Again we see considerable differences, although some of the major hurricanes still feature on the map. But clearly it is not guaranteed that each TC get more intense under PGW. To the contrary, most of the TC shown here seem to weaken (except in the simulations by GERICS (REMO-NH). Also the tracks are not identical, implying that studying impact changes is not straightforward, unless we aggregate / pool results. A similar pattern is shown when we use all years. Many storms weaken, some seem to intensify, and most display small changes in track location.
