## Summary and conclusions

EUCP Caribbean CPM and RCM simulations: ERA5 + PGW, focus on Hurricane season. Top-10 seasons according to criteria. Includes 2017 (Irma). Data will be used by WP4 for eg., storm surge modelling.

Preliminary results: wind speed and precipitation. Robust increase in precipitation maxima, wind speed change less obvious. Poor man’s tracking: Not all tropical cyclones reproduced in REF and PGW: Optimal conditions in present-day climate not necessarily more favorable for development in future climate. Further analysis necessary.

Still to do:
- More extended analysis, including pooling of results.
- Comparison to observations
- Impact modelling by WP4: storm surges
- Discussion of relevance of PGW versus GCM-forced.
