## (Some) advantages of large ensemble simulations

- Large ensembles are many realisations of the same climate model experiment,
  the many realisations capture internal variability within the climate system
  (Deser et al., 2020, NCC).
- Large ensembles thus contain a large diversity of weather events, we can use
  this to select events and investigate drivers or changes (Van der Wiel et al.,
  2020, ERL).
