## Hourly precipitation extremes and storm motion

A comparison of the maximum hourly precipitation around EPP cases versus the Corfidi Vector magnitude shows a negative relationship for both the current and future climate simulations. Clearly, the extreme values of maximum accumulated hourly precipitation occur with slower storm motions. The PDF distribution of the Corfidi Vector magnitude for all EPPs vs EPPs with 150 mm or higher hourly precipitation around them also agrees with this statement. Here, the shift of the peak towards slower storm motion is also evident for the future climate.
