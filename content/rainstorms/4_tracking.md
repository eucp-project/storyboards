## Tracking results from model data

Running a precipitation-tracking algorithm on re-gridded hourly precipitation output from the model, precipitation areas with at least one 12 km grid point with ≥20 mmh−1 are detected and the movement speed distribution of such storms are analyzed. The frequency of such storms robustly increases in the future. 

Similar to SEPPs, slow-moving storm systems (≤3 ms−1) analyzed with this approach are most frequent in autumn in the current climate, but become much more frequent, with a frequency increase higher than that of faster-moving systems, in the future. Furthermore, storm speed distributions in all seasons become skewed to the left; and are thus slower on average year-round.
