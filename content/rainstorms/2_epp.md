## Extreme Precipitation Potential and Slow-moving Extreme Precipitation Potential in the present and end-of-century (RCP8.5) climates

All of Europe is prone to intense rainstorms as measured by EPP, but the central Mediterranean experiences the highest frequency of cases, both currently and in the future. In contrast, 
All of Europe is prone to intense rainstorms as measured by EPP, and these are 7.4x more frequent by the end of century (from ∼24 per 100×100km area in the present climate to ~175 in the future). On the other hand, the slow-moving ones, i.e. SEPPs are relatively rare in the current climate but become widespread across the continent by 2100, with a 10.6x figure (changing from ~0.7 to 7.2 per 100×100km area).

In concert with these increases, the number of events with precipitation ≥100 mm h−1 (about 20% of EPPs in the current climate) increases threefold, while ≥150 mm h−1 is experienced 4× more frequently, and 200 mm h−1 5.2× more frequently by 2100.
