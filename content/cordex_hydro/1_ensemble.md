The EURO-CORDEX initiative developed an ensemble of Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations at a horizontal resolution of ~11 km â€“ in total 20 RCMs were used here.

This study builds upon a set of readily available European scale hydrological simulations. The variation between the models provides insights on the influence of bias-correction, calibration and hydrological model selected.

Three hydrological models were selected:

1. **LISFLOOD** from JRC, the model is calibrated and the CORDEX data is
   bias-corrected
2. **CWatM** from IIASA, the model is calibrated on a regional scale, no
   bias-correction is applied
3. **wflow_sbm**, the model is parameterized based on soil, land use and vegetation
   characteristics, no bias-correction is applied

Changes in discharge are assessed between the period 1981-2010 and 2031-2060 for RCP8p5.
