headline: Projected changes â€“ minimum flows
---

- There are clear indications for decreases in minimum flow in Southern European
  basins and increases in Northern basins.
- The consensus between the different hydrological models and climate models is
  large for the Northern basins (Glomma, Angermanalven) and the Southern basins
  (Ebro and Tanaro)
- For the Central European basins the signal is mixed and the choice of
  hydrological model and RCM does influence the impact estimation.
