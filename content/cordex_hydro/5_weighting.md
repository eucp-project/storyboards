headline: Performance-based weighting

Performance based weighting is used to obtain a more robust change signal from
the ensemble of future projections.

Projected changes are displayed for weighted change in annual mean discharge
(mean Q), annual maximum discharge (maxQ) and 7 day minimum discharge (NM7Q)

Two weighting methods have been applied:

  * **ClimWIP**: Climate model Weighting by Independence and Performance. This
    method evaluates the historical performance of GCMs and their independence.
    Focus of the weighting was on meteorological variables
  * **REA**: Reliability Ensemble Averaging. This method evaluates the
    historical performance of the models and the distance of its change
    projections to the future projected ensemble weighted change. Focus of the
    weighting was on river discharges near the outlet of the basin.

For part of the basins the influence of the weighting was limited. There is
little difference between the weighted and non-weigthed ensemble mean change.

For other basins the REA method deviates from the other change projections. We
assume there is a strong influence of the relatively large historical bias of
the RCM based simulations from observations. A single RCM with the smallest
historical bias is highly favored by the method.
