## Central European summer temperature change: using the same model pool

* Using the same model pool reduces differences in the unconstrained distribution to a minimum. Remaining difference for HistC:
    1. calculation of percentiles (empirically vs Gaussian)
    2. slightly different handling of internal variability
* Methods consistently narrow the uncertainty range and agree on slightly less warming
