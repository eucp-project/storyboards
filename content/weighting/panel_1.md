## Background

Many different methods exist to quantify and constrain projections of future climate. But the results can often not directly be compared as no coordinated framework exists. Differences in the methods setup include:

* variable (e.g., temperature vs precipitation)
* region (e.g., global vs Europe)
* season (e.g., annual vs summer)
* time period (e.g., 2041-2060 vs 2080-2099)
* type of change (e.g., absolute vs relative change)
* models used (including ensemble members used)
* uncertainties included (e.g., internal variability vs forced response only)
* reported results (e.g., likely vs interquartile range)
