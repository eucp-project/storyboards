## Central European summer temperature change

* Most methods show a slightly lower median warming than in the unconstrained case
* Most methods show a reduction in spread
* Some divergence in the constrained distributions from the different methods (see next panel)
* Also the unconstrained distributions differ  (common model pool **not** used here)
