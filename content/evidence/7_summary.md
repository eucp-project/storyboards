## Summary​

Examining results from multiple lines of evidence makes it easier to put the results of a study in context. ​

In this example, information suggests that the models used in the study are a reasonable representation of the most likely outcomes indicated by most other lines of evidence.​

However, there is a significant tail risk of a drier future outcome than suggested by the models used in the study. There is also a less likely tail risk of wetter outcomes.
