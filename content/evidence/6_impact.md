## Impact of dynamical downscaling​

The impact of downscaling the CMIP5 models is mixed, causing both increases and decreases in the precipitation change signal relative to the driving GCM depending on the RCM used. The variance is more positively skewed though, with larger changes on the wetter side. Choosing other CMIP5 models to downscale could conceivably produce wetter or drier results than the existing CORDEX range.​

For the two EUCP CPM models, the impact of downscaling the driving CORDEX models gives either a similar or a wetter result compared to the driving model.
