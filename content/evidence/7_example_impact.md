## Impact of dynamical downscaling​

The impact of downscaling the CMIP5 models is mixed, causing both increases and
decreases in the precipitation change signal. However, there are a large subset
of models in which the increase in precipitation change signal from the RCM is
significant enough to change the sign of the change signal (top left quadrant).
For example the CNRM-CM5 HIRHAM5 CORDEX model (point 11) indicates an almost 30%
increase in mean precipitation, but was driven by a GCM with roughly a -5%
change in mean precipitation. ​

For the 2 CPM models; for 1 model (SMHI HCLIM38-ALADIN) there is little change
in the overall signal, but the other model (ICTP RegCM4-7-0) gives a notably
wetter precipitation change signal from the CPM compared to the driving RCM.​
