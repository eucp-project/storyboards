## Multiple lines of evidence​

Users of climate information now have many sources of climate data to choose
from.​

The different sources have different characteristics such as resolution which
means that some sources are better suited to particular applications.​

However, the different datasets sample different sources of uncertainty and
therefore will offer different uncertainty ranges. ​

Although high resolution data (e.g. from convection permitting models) is often
preferred by users, the number of model simulations available is often limited
compared to lower resolution simulations.​
