## Recent research into future climate changes and their impact on landslide risk​

[Niculiţă, M. (2020). Landslide Hazard Induced by Climate Changes in North-Eastern Romania. Climate Change Management, (May), 245–265.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37425-9_13)

This study finds that climate projections imply a return to higher rainfall
intensities that were last seen in the 1970s  and 1980s and which coincided with
increased landslide events.​

However, the study is based on a subset of the CORDEX multi-model ensemble,
consisting of 10 models.​

Can further information that puts these models in the context the wider CORDEX
ensemble, as well as other climate model ensembles, help with interpreting the
results of this study?​
