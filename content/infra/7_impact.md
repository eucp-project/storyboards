## A long road to impact

A shared infrastructure provides access to both data and compute, and with
libraries like ESMValTool we see the dawn of a new age, where reusability and
reproducibility are axiomatic. This provides a new and (to some extent)
standardized way of sharing codified methods, enabling an efficient scientific
exchange mechanism.

The ESMValTool community has come a long way in establishing a robust
development process which includes automated testing and peer-review of both
technical and scientific aspects.

We believe this is an opportunity for climate services. The developments
described in this storyboard show a pathway from exploratory analysis to routine
evaluation, and from routine evaluation to actionable climate information. In a
sense, it looks similar to a continous integration framework. It is interesting
to consider how this framework can best be exploited in an operational setting.
