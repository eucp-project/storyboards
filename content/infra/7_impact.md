## A long road to impact

Traditionally, data was exchanged on floppy disks and methods were described in
papers. As science and technology advanced, data volumes and compute
requirements exploded and the old ways were no longer sustainable.

Nowadays, a shared infrastructure provides access to both data and compute. Old
habits for sharing methods are still around, but with libraries like ESMValTool
we see the dawn of a new age, where reusability and reproducibility are
axiomatic.

The ESMValTool community has come a long way in establishing a robust
development process which includes automated testing and peer-review of both
technical and scientific aspects.

We believe this is an opportunity for climate services. The developments
described in this storyboard show a pathway from exploratory analysis to routine
evaluation, and from routine evaluation to actionable climate information. In a
sense, it looks similar to a continous integration framework. It is interesting
to consider how this framework can find its way into an operational setting.
