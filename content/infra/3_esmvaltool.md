## ESMValTool

EMSValTool is *A community diagnostic and performance metrics tool for routine
evaluation of earth system models in CMIP.* It comes with a large collection of
reusable "recipes" that, by their nature, document a climate analytics workflow.
These recipes are quality controlled with both a technical and a scientific
review, and well documented.

By providing common pre-processing functions, ESMValTool helps to standardize
scientific workflows. The tool also tracks provenance information. As such,
ESMValTool facilitates a FAIR and open research process.

## EUCP contributions

New recipes:

* [ClimWIP](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/recipes/recipe_climwip.html): Climate model weighting by independence and performance
* [KCS](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/recipes/recipe_kcs.html): KNMI climate scenarios
* [...](https://github.com/MetOffice/EUCP_WP5_Lines_of_Evidence): Evaluation of ensemble projections accross projects/scales (work in progress)

Added functionality:

* Added a Python API (see next tab)
* Better support for scientific regions
* Improved multimodel statistics and added ensemble statistics (WIP)
* Improved support for CORDEX data and added support for FPS-convection data (WIP)
* Contributed to, and taught, the [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/)
