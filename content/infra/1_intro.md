## EUCP infrastructure

EUCP aims to provide digital infrastructure in support of the overall objective
of delivering accessible, authoritative and actionable climate information.

The infrastructure should facilitate aggregation and blending of 'raw' climate
data from various sources into high-level data products that are useful for
end-users. To this end, EUCP develops methods for merging and constraining
climate model output, and we strive to make these methods easily reusable.

Storage and compute resources from [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/en) are used for
data exchange during the project, and to develop an initial prototype of the
envisioned infrastructure. For long-term sustainability and public access, we
are leveraging the European climate infrastructure developed by
[IS-ENES](https://portal.enes.org/services).

ESMValTool is seen as a key component of this infrastructure, providing a
protocol for sharing climate analytics workflows, simplifying data access, and
facilitating the development of new methods.
