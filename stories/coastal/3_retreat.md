## Shoreline retreat in Europe

Using satellite derived sandy beach locations and spatially varying nearshore slopes data, projections of shoreline retreat are made.

A European averaged median shoreline retreat of 31 m (22 m) is projected under RCP 8.5 (4.5) by year 2050, relative to the baseline year 2010. 

These values change to 97 m (54 m) under RCP 8.5 (4.5) by year 2100.

Spatial variability along the European coastline is pronounced depending on the nearshore slopes variability.

This retreat would translate to 2,500 km<sup>2</sup> (1,400 km<sup>2</sup>) of coastal land loss by 2100.
