## Uncertainty analysis

A variance-based sensitivity analysis was used to quantify the uncertainty of the coastal land loss estimates. This method measures the contribution of each of the uncertain input parameters; 1) nearshore slope data, 2) sandy beach location data, 3) RCP scenario, 4) Sea level rise (SLR).

This allows for quantifying and comparing the uncertainties related to the choice of input geophysical datasets (epistemic) versus the inherent uncertainty associated with RCPs and SLR projections.

On average epistemic uncertainty accounts for 45% (26%) by 2050 (2100), with high variability between countries

This provides insights on areas that geophysical datasets should be updated with monitoring and observations.
