## Framework for coastal land loss projections

Global probabilistic sea level rise projections were used under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. For RCP 8.5, a high-end RCP 8.5 scenario based on IPCC AR5 but with a higher contribution from Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets was used.

Two different maps of the location of sandy beaches and two different approaches for their nearshore slopes are used to account for epistemic input data uncertainty.

Shoreline retreat is projected in the feature at sandy beach locations on 1 km alongshore grid around the European coastline.

Sandy beach land loss is calculated by aggregating the total shoreline retreat per NUTS3 region.
