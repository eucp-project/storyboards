## Contributing groups/models
Several groups signed up to contribute with CPM (and RCM) simulations. 

**CPM**
- KNMI – HCLIM38-AROME (nested in RACMO)
- SMHI – HCLIM38-AROME (direct)
- ICTP – RegCM4-7 (direct)
- GERICS – REMO-NH (direct)

**RCM**
- KNMI – RACMO (1979-2020)
- DMI – HCLIM38-AROME 12km(!)

## Simulation strategy
Simulation strategy was to come up with a top-10 list of hurricane seasons and simulate these using ERA5 as boundary and initial conditions (REF). A second set of simulations (PGW) was then created, by adding CMIP5-derived delta fields to the ERA5 boundary conditions. In this way, entire seasons were ‘futurized’. 

Note that within the domain, the models generate their own internal dynamics so it is not guaranteed that each REF and PGW run gives the same number of tropical cyclones. KNMI ran a third set of simulations using a uniform temperature increase.
