## Tropical cyclones variability is huge

As the previous slide already showed, there is huge spatial and temporal variability in the tracks of tropical cyclones. There is a large interannual variability with some years being relatively quiet and others very active. 

Because of finite resources, only a few hurricane seasons could be simulated. Therefore it made sense to attempt a pseudo-global warming approach, in which observed hurricane seasons are simulated twice: once with observed (ERA5) forcing at lateral boundaries, and a second time in which the same seasons are ‘futurized’ by adding seasonally varying delta-fields obtained from climate-change experiments (subset of CMIP5).
