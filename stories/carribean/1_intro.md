## Caribbean

Many of the regional climate simulations carried out as part of EUCP were situated over Europe. On explicit request by the EU, EUCP also conducted a limited number of simulations with very high resolution regional climate models for a number outer-European domains. One of the domains is the Caribbean, known for its sunshine and sandy beaches, but also for devastating tropical cyclones, monster waves and coastal erosion.


## Convection permitting (CP) simulations

The research question addressed here is what very high resolution CPM simulations could add to the story of climate change in the region, with a special interest in the wind and precipitation characteristics of tropical cyclones. Additionally, it could perhaps be used to apply methodology derived primarily for the European domains, to these other domains. Two other sets of outer-European CPM simulations were created within EUCP: one for Madeira, and one for the island of La RÃ©union. These are not discussed in this presentation.
