## Outline of the problem

Predictions of European summer temperature (EUST; defined as the box in the right figure) 2 to 9 years ahead (decadal predictions) can provide useful information for decision makers. A promising tool for performing such predictions are global climate models, which simulate interactions between ocean, atmosphere, ice and vegetation, and the human impact on the climate system. In recent climate models, decadal predictions agree well with observed EUST during the period 1970-2014.

Much of this observed skill in decadal EUST predictions stems from anthropogenic, volcanic and solar forcing to the climate system. But naturally occurring unforced internal climate variations can also have a pronounced impact on changes of EUST. Unfortunately, unforced variability of EUST is not directly predictable in current climate models. Our aim is to suggest a statistical fix to the climate modelsâ€™ inability to predict unforced EUST on the decadal time scale.
