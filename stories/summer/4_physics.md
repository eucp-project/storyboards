## Short excursion: the physics behind the link

Analysing sea level pressure (SLP) to get an indication of the atmospheric dynamics involved in transporting the unforced SST-EUST signal indicates little dynamical influence beyond local heating from the ocean. It is therefore likely that local ocean heat release together with thermodynamic processes accomplish the unforced seasonal ENAMED SST - EUST link.
