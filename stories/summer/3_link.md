## An unforced observed link between North Atlantic SST and EUST

We examine residuals for the period 1900-1969 in HadISST and HadCRU observations. This period was chosen to avoid overlap with the prediction test period 1970-2014. We find an unforced link between spring North Atlantic SST and EUST.

Particularly the eastern North Atlantic and Mediterranean region stands out in terms of unforced spring SST influence on EUST. However, another important criterion for the construction of our dyn-stat model is that the SST region is predictable. Comparing a prediction skill map for unforced spring SST with the areas that significantly impact EUST identifies Eastern North Atlantic - Mediterranean (ENAMED; blue outlines in the figure) SST as a promising index for dyn-stat prediction of unforced EUST.
