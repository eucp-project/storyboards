## More precipitation extremes in scenarios
- End-of-C (2080-2100), RCP8.5 changes in precipitation distributions;
- Map plots: CPM change signal in average (left) and heavy (right) summer (JJA) precipitation,
- Line plots: ASoP analysis for present climate (top) and changes (scn - ctrl) (bottom) of summer (JJA) hourly precipitation (Pr).
- Distinct shifts in precipitation distributions - reductions in low intensities, increases in higher intensities.
- More emphasized change in CPM compared to RCM.
