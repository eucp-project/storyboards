## How do we benefit from using CPM models in Fenno-Scandinavia?

- More realistic representation of precipitation, especially in the summer season (improvements in frequency, duration and intensity)
- Potential added value through systematically different climate change response in heavy summer precipitation. 
- Some suggestions of different climate change responses between CPM and RCM in solid versus liquid precipitation in the Scandes mountains.
- Near-surface wind speeds are also better represented in the Scandes. Ongoing work to investigate potential added value in climate scenarios as well as more process based perspectives (e.g. orographic down-slope wind-storms).
