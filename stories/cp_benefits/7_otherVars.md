## Not just precipitation?

- Added value from CPM is evident for precipitation - what about other variables?
- We could expect improved representations of winds (e.g. convective wind gusts, orographic down-slope wind storms, thermal circulations).

Figures show ongoing work:
- Top panels: PDFs of winter near surface wind speed, comparing CPM (red) and RCM (blue) with station values in Sweden (black). Left panel is for low-lying stations and right panel for stations in mountains.

In mountains there is clear indication of added value in CPM model, especially in the tail distribution.

- Bottom figure shows the wind speed as a function of altitude in present climate in RCM (blue/green) and CPM (red/purple).
