## More precipitation extremes in scenarios
- Changes (in % per degree warming) of high precipitation (Pr) percentiles (hourly data) in winter and summer over Fenno-Scandinavia.
- Stronger GCM influence in winter when RCM/CPM combinations are relatively close.
- Differences in RCM and CPM responses are much more pronounced in summer when forcing from boundaries is not as constraining (compared to DJF) and local convection becomes more prominent.
