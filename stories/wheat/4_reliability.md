## Forecast quality assessment of SPEI6 and HMDI3: Reliability

The reliability of initialized decadal forecast in predicting multi-year averaged SPEI6 and HMDI3 over global wheat harvesting region. 

This figure shows reliability diagrams (lines) for probabilistic categorical forecasts (tercile events) of unadjusted and calibrated SPEI6 (top) and HMDI3 (bottom) estimate over Global wheat growing region. The frequency of occurrence of each bin for each category is shown to the right of the panels.
