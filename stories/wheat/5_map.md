## Decadal prediction for wheat sector

An illustration of a potential climate service product for the wheat sector based on categorical events. 

This figure shows high probability of dry conditions (below-normal category of SPEI6) and heat stress events (above-normal category of HMDI3) over most of the wheat growing regions for the forecast years 2015-2019.

Multi-year probabilistic calibrated forecast (a, b) and observed (c, d) most likely tercile category of SPEI6 (left) and HMDI3 (right) for the year 2014â€“2018 over the wheat harvesting regions that presents positive FRPSS values.
