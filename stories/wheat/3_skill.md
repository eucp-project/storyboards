## Forecast quality assessment of SPEI6 and HMDI3: Prediction skill

The probabilistic skill of initialized decadal forecast in predicting multi-year averaged SPEI6 and HMDI3 is presented for the months preceding the wheat harvest on a global spatial scale.

Fair Ranked probability skill score (FRPSS) for tercile events of calibrated SPEI6 (left) and HMDI3  (right) averaged over forecast years 1–5 using decadal prediction, with respect to the observational climatology during the winter wheat harvest months for the period 1961–2014.
