## Outline of the problem

Predictions of European summer temperature (EUST; defined as the box in the
right figure) 2 to 9 years ahead (decadal predictions) can provide useful
information for decision makers. A promising tool for performing such
predictions are global climate models, which simulate interactions between
ocean, atmosphere, ice and vegetation, and the human impact on the climate
system. In recent climate models, decadal predictions agree well with observed
EUST during the period 1970-2014.

Much of this observed skill in decadal EUST predictions stems from
anthropogenic, volcanic and solar forcing to the climate system. But naturally
occurring unforced internal climate variations can also have a pronounced impact
on changes of EUST. Unfortunately, unforced variability of EUST is not directly
predictable in current climate models. Our aim is to suggest a statistical fix
to the climate models' inability to predict unforced EUST on the decadal time
scale.

## The idea behind this study

The struggle of climate models to predict unforced decadal variations of
temperature over continents is well-documented. Skilful dynamical model
predictions for unforced variations are mostly reported for oceanic properties
such as heat content or sea surface temperature (SST). Our idea: identify an
observed (statistical) connection between the dynamically predictable ocean and
dynamically unpredictable EUST to provide skilful dynamical-statistical decadal
prediction of unforced EUST. Such a dyn-stat prediction would rely on skilful
decadal unforced SST prediction to infer statistically EUST predictions using
SST-EUST pathways.

## The residuals approach
These investigations require an estimate of observed unforced variability. This
variability is difficult to estimate. One approach is to construct the mean of
historical model simulations with global climate models. These are different
except in their external forcing. Their mean can separate the response of the
climate system to forcing, so the forced response can be subtracted from the
observed climate signal. This residuals method was introduced by Smith et al.
(2019). Here, we use it for the first time to also examine unforced interactions
in the climate system. We construct the residuals from an average over 28
different climate models with a total of more than 250 simulations from the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP 6).

## An unforced observed link between North Atlantic SST and EUST

We examine residuals for the period 1900-1969 in HadISST and HadCRU
observations. This period was chosen to avoid overlap with the prediction test
period 1970-2014. We find an unforced link between spring North Atlantic SST and
EUST.

Particularly the eastern North Atlantic and Mediterranean region stands out in
terms of unforced spring SST influence on EUST. However, another important
criterion for the construction of our dyn-stat model is that the SST region is
predictable. Comparing a prediction skill map for unforced spring SST with the
areas that significantly impact EUST identifies Eastern North Atlantic -
Mediterranean (ENAMED; blue outlines in the figure) SST as a promising index for
dyn-stat prediction of unforced EUST.

## Short excursion: the physics behind the link

Analysing sea level pressure (SLP) to get an indication of the atmospheric
dynamics involved in transporting the unforced SST-EUST signal indicates little
dynamical influence beyond local heating from the ocean. It is therefore likely
that local ocean heat release together with thermodynamic processes accomplish
the unforced seasonal ENAMED SST - EUST link.

## Dynamical-statistical predictions of unforced EUST

In our framework, a prediction of unforced EUST is constructed from a dynamical
prediction of unforced spring ENAMED SST, which is then rescaled based on the
local historically observed summer temperature variance at each grid point. Such
predictions outperform purely dynamical predictions over most of southern
Europe, leading to significant prediction skill. In some areas, the skill
increase is even significant.

Our findings highlight the value of using the skill of dynamical decadal ocean
predictions to harvest skill for the unforced signal of EUST variations 2-9
years ahead.
