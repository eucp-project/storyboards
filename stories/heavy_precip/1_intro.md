## Introduction

Thunderstorms are among the most fascinating weather phenomena. They are
characterized by lightning and thunder, cause strong wind gusts and typically
they bring intense rain. In this way the most severe thunderstorms can be
perceived as heavy precipitation events (HPEs). We here will present a
methodology that, upon objective criteria, identifies HPEs in
convection-permitting observations and numerical models.


Flash floods rank among the most severe hazards caused by weather extremes.
Typically the precipitation events have a strong convective character, are
relatively small in spatial scale and short-lived. Thus it is challenging to
accurately forecast them and to represent them in climate models with coarse
grid spacing.
