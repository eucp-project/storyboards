## Conclusions

Through the application of trackers valuable information about the events
causing hazards like flash floods can be obtained. Here statistics obtained from
9 year-periods of an observational dataset, and two cpRCM ensembles, one driven
by reanalysis ("evaluation") and one driven by CMIP5-GCMs are presented. On left
we find properties describing the scale of the HPEs and on the right properties
that describe their intensity. In this way models can be evluated against
observations.

Eventually the same can be done for climate projections, promising valuable
information about how HPEs are going to change in a future warmer climate.
