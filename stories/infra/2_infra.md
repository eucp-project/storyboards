## IS-ENES

IS-ENES is the InfraStructure for the European Network for Earth System
modelling. Currently, this infrastructure is maintained and further developed
under the IS-ENES3 project.

IS-ENES provides access to climate data through ESGF. It also provides compute
resources, with many commonly used software libraries pre-installed.

In IS-ENES3, data access options are greatly improved, with a complete redesign
of the Climate4Impact portal, as well as access through JupyterHub, among
others.

## IS-ENES & EUCP

EUCP leverages the IS-ENES infrastructure to provide access to its data and
methods. DCPP and CPM data produced within EUCP have been or will be uploaded to
ESGF. Some of our methods have already been integrated into the ESMValTool. We
have also extended the ESMValTool with a Python API so as to make it usable from
within the IS-ENES Jupyter environments.
