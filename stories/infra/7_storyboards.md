## Project overview at a glance

Research output comes in many forms. Datasets, scientific publications, improved
models, software implementations, figures, video's, increased inderstanding,
example (web) applications, (technical) reports, et cetera.

Even if all information is publicly available, it is not always easy to find.
This inhibits obtaining a quick yet comprehensive overview of project outputs.

With these storyboards, we attempt to provide such an overview of important
project outputs. The storyboards focus on high-level information, linking to
external sources for more information where appropriate.

We hope they will prove useful.
