## Output web pages

The new Python API paved the way for automatic generation of HTML reports,
including:

* Description
* Authors/maintainers
* Projects
* References
* Output figures
* Output files
* Provenance information

These reports have been developed under IS-ENES3 funding. Development of a
revamped ESMValTool result browser is also foreseen.
