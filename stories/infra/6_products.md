## Custom data products

While the Jupyter interface is very suitable for researchers and developers, end
users typically have different requirements. Therefore, in EUCP, we are
developing a number of prototype web applications that can inform future service
products.

For example, we are working on an [atlas](https://eucp-project.github.io/atlas/)
of constrained vs unconstrained climate projections derived from different EUCP
methods. We will add guidance and further documentation, and iterate on the
design in a process of co-development with users.

While the content of this atlas is currently not coupled to the shared
infrastructure, it would be a natural extension. In fact, multiple groups are
currently experimenting with adding custom *front ends* to ESMValTool output, to
enable interactive output products.
