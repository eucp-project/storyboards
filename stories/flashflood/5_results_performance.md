## Results

- Kling-Gupta efficiency for 130 gauging stations in the modelled domain for the
  ERA-Interim driven simulation. Assessment period 2002-2012 for daily
  discharges.​

Rhine at Basel: KGE 0.62​

Model chain of ERA-Interim driven convection-permitting climate model and
distributed hydrological model gives reasonable performance. Recorded flash
floods from databases are reproduced in the modelling results (not shown).​
