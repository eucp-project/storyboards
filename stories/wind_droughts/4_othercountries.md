## Wind energy drought in different countries​

The figure shows the risk ratios in each country during different climate
periods. ​

When the risk ratio >1, the low wind energy events are more frequent compared
with the earlier climate period.  ​

Most countries are experiencing more frequent low wind energy events compared
with the previous period. In the future, low wind energy events will become more
common in most countries, especially in northern countries where wind energy
drought will occur more frequently. ​
