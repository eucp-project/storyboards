## Simulating intense convective storms

Simulating an intense convective storm is very challenging due, among other things, to a very high sensitivity to initial conditions and a general difficulty of the models to resolve small-scale interactions. Here, we use a sophisticated ensemble approach with the HARMONIE-AROME limited-area numerical weather prediction model to represent the event.

The figure shows the hourly precipitation at 16 UTC for all ensemble 13 members (a,d-o), a calculated risk of exceeding a threshold of 60 mm/h (b) and the associated ensemble mean (c). The red star indicates the location of Copenhagen.
