## Take home messages

- The Harmonie CP NWP model can capture the nature of the extreme Copenhagen event of July 2, 2011
- While it is not necessarily possible to simulate the Copenhagen extreme event with perfection, it is possible to capture the possible severity and a reasonably accurate location when taking an ensemble approach.
- The risk of achieving precipitation amounts such as those observed has increased due to global warming.
- The risk of achieving even more intense precipitation rates over the affected region increases with further warming.
