## Monthly distribution

Both EPP and SEPP peaks in the late summer and early autumn, with land areas more towards the summer and sea areas to autumn. Changes over the land are more pronounced compared to the sea. Currently, 52% of EPP cases occur over land; by 2100 this jumps to 61%, with increases in land (sea) EPP frequencies of 8.6× (6×) respectively. SEPPs occur relatively equally over land (48%) and sea (52%) in the current climate but an enormous increase in land SEPPs (14.3×), with a smaller, but still significant, increase in sea SEPPs (7.3×) increases the land fraction to 65% by 2100.
