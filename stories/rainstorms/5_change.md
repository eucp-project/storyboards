## Change in components

The large increase in EPPs stems mainly from the moisture ingredient, with a dramatic increase of cases with q ≥ 10 gkg−1 in all months, while projected w ≥ 2 ms−1 cases are higher only from June to September. By 2100, the CPM projects 29× more cases with very moist environments (exceeding the q threshold) than for the current climate. The average q increases by ∼35%. The moistest environment is found in August (5.42 g kg−1 for current climate, increasing to 7.26 g kg−1 by 2100), but change in q peaks in November with a 51% increase. By 2100, the CPM projects 29× more cases with very moist environments (exceeding the q threshold) than for the current climate. 

By 2100, there is higher frequency of slow-storm environments, except during February–April, with the annual number of slow-moving storms projected to increase by 20%. We find the largest increases in August–November, ranging from 31% to 65%, and peaking in September. Since this coincides with the peak exceedance months of thermodynamic thresholds, the kinematic environment of these high accumulation storms also contributes to, and enhances, the extreme precipitation rate for a given locality, resulting in an almost 11-fold increase in SEPPs compared to a 7.4-fold increase in EPPs by 2100.
