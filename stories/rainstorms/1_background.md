## The background and method

The ingredients-based approach for forecasting heavy precipitation (Doswell et al. 1986) suggests that the amount of precipitation in a location is equal to the product of average rainfall rate and duration. For a convective storm, the average rainfall rate is a function of specific humidity (available moisture), vertical velocity (condensation rate of the moisture), and precipitation efficiency (fraction of condensed water falling to ground). Local duration depends on many factors including organization, size and movement of the storm system, but we focus on the (slower) storm motion only, to maximize local exposure.

Using 2.2km pan-European simulations for the present (1998-2007) and RCP8.5 future (~2100) simulations, we calculate the co-existence of high moisture (specific humidity ≥ 10 g kg−1 at 850 hPa) and ascent (vertical velocity ≥ 2 m s−1 ascent at 700 hPa) with 3-hourly intervals, namely ”Extreme Precipitation Potential” (EPP). Neglecting the effects of highly uncertain precipitation efficiency, this approximates to hourly precipitation extremes. Adding another condition for storm motion (Corfidi Vector ≤3 m s−1), we look for ”Slow-moving Extreme Precipitation Potential” (SEPP).
