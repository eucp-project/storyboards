## Relative humidity in the mid-troposphere

Although we exclude the precipitation efficiency factor, we have processed an analysis of mid-tropospheric relative humidity to investigate one of the main contributing parameters to precipitation efficiency. The average relative humidity for the whole domain at the 500 hPa level is seasonally variable, with lower values in the warm season for both current and future climates. The future simulation shows decreases in relative humidity, with differences compared to the current climate simulation highest in the spring. The decrease is more limited in August, September and October, which corresponds to our high season for EPP and SEPP cases. 

For both current and future simulations, extremely high hourly precipitation amounts occur exclusively within high relative humidity environments; which validates the role of environmental relative humidity in terms of precipitation efficiency.
