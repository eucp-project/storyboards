## Selection of simulated analogues

- We define metrics that describes (part of) the event of interest, this is done
  by choosing a variable and its spatial and temporal properties.
- Using this event definition, we select simulated events from the large
  ensemble dataset by means of maximum similarity.
- In the case study we used three event metrics, metric 1 is shown here. Twenty
  simulated events were selected, each of these with very high August-October
  precipitation deficit as the observed event in 2018. We took the mean over
  these twenty events, and used this composite 'analogue' in the remainder of
  the study.
