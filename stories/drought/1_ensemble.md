## (Some) advantages of large ensemble simulations

- **Large ensembles** are many realisations of the same climate model experiment,
  the many realisations capture **internal** variability within the climate system
  (Deser et al., 2020, NCC).
- Large ensembles thus contain a large diversity of weather events, we can use
  this to **select events** and **investigate drivers or changes** (Van der Wiel et al.,
  2020, ERL).
