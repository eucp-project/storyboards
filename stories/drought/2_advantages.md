## (Some) advantages of storylines

- People are very well trained in listening to and understanding stories. Just
  think: "Once upon a timeâ€¦".
- **Storylines** improve risk awareness and decision-making processes. This is due
  to their **connection with observed events** and user-focus (Hazeleger et al.,
  2015, NCC; Shepherd et al., 2018, CC).
- In this work we aim to combine the positives of large ensembles and storylines
  to answer societally relevant questions.
