## Investigation of climate change and analogues

- We compute analogues using three large ensemble datasets, describing
  present-day climate and two future warmer climates (pre-industrial + 2C
  warming and +3C warming).
- These analogues can then be compared to identify the influence of climate
  change on the event of interest. The analogues show what the event might look
  like in a warmer future climate. 
- In our case study, we find that **future droughts are more severe**. Lower
  precipitation and higher evapotranspiration lead to **higher future peak
  precipitation deficits**. The exact timing and magnitude of changes are metric
  dependent.
