## Proposed methodology

Two step process:

1. Select simulated events like the observed event: 'analogues'
1. Compare the analogues in present and future climates

To verify the quality of the results, we have to consider:

- How to define the observed event, how to select analogues?
- Are there analogues that resemble the observed event?
- Does this provide robust and reliable climate change information?

In the remainder of this storyboard we provide a **proof-of-concept**, creating
storylines of **future European drought events like 2018**.
