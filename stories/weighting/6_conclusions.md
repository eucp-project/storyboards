headline: Remaining differences and Conclusions

## Remaining differences in the underlying method properties
There are remaining differences in the underlying method properties. See the table in the left.

## Conclusions and outlook
* A common testing framework allows to consistently compare constrained projections from several different methods 
* Methods agree on several aspects but disagree on others 
* Agreement depends on the target (variable, region, mean/extreme changes)
* Some divergence in the constrained projections from different methods is expected due to differences in their underlying properties

- How can we choose between methods (if they disagree)?
1. Considering the decision context (mean or extreme changes important?)
2. Combining different methods (e.g., Hegerl et al. 2021)
3. Selecting methods based on an objective skill measure (e.g., Oâ€™Reilly et al. in preparation)
