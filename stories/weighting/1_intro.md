## Background

Many different methods exist to quantify and constrain projections of future climate, differing in both their evaluation against observed changes and their underlying methodological assumptions.

In order to investigate if different methods agree with each other, a coordinated testing framework is needed. Otherwise, method results reported in the scientific literature are often not comparable because they differ not only in their approach (which we want to analyse) but also in their setup such as:

* variable (e.g., temperature vs precipitation)
* region (e.g., global vs Europe)
* season (e.g., annual vs summer)
* time period (e.g., 2041-2060 vs 2080-2099)
* type of change (e.g., absolute vs relative change)
* models used (including ensemble members used)
* uncertainties included (e.g., internal variability vs forced response only)
* reported results (e.g., likely vs interquartile range)
