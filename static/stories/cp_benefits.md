## Benefits and added value of convection-permitting climate modeling over Fenno-Scandinavia
Snow, ice, the long coastline, and the Scandes mountains, they all make the
Fenno-Scandinavia a complex region. The box plots show observed distribution of
daily mean 2 meter temperature (T2m, top panel) and precipitation (Pr, bottom)
for winter (DJF, left half) and summer (JJA, right half) seasons.

## A mini-ensemble
A mini-ensemble is used to explore the climate in this region. The modelling
region is illustrated in the left figure and the configuration is listed below:
- HCLIM-ALADIN @ 12km resolution, HCLIM-AROME @ 3km
- ERA-I driven runs; 1998–2018
- GCM driven runs; 1985–2005 / 2040–2060 / 2080–2100
- 2 forcing GCMs: EC-Earth & GFDL-CM3 (CMIP5)
- 2 emission scenarios: RCP8.5 and RCP4.5

## Why the use of CPM model?
- For precipitation, there are obvious arguments in favor of using CPM models
  over Fenno-Scandinavia (and elsewhere).
- Left panel: Probability density function (PDF) of summer (JJA) hourly
  precipitation over Sweden comparing HCLIM3 CPM and HCLIM12 regional climate
  model (RCM) with radar observations.
- Right panel: Maps of 99.9th percentile of summer (JJA) hourly precipitation
  over Sweden in HCLIM12, HCLIM3 and radar observations.

## More precipitation extremes in scenarios
- End-of-C (2080-2100), RCP8.5 changes in precipitation distributions;
- Map plots: CPM change signal in average (left) and heavy (right) summer (JJA)
  precipitation,
- Line plots: ASoP analysis for present climate (top) and changes (scn - ctrl)
  (bottom) of summer (JJA) hourly precipitation (Pr).
- Distinct shifts in precipitation distributions - reductions in low
  intensities, increases in higher intensities.
- More emphasized change in CPM compared to RCM.

## More precipitation extremes in scenarios
- Changes (in % per degree warming) of high precipitation (Pr) percentiles
  (hourly data) in winter and summer over Fenno-Scandinavia.
- Stronger GCM influence in winter when RCM/CPM combinations are relatively
  close.
- Differences in RCM and CPM responses are much more pronounced in summer when
  forcing from boundaries is not as constraining (compared to DJF) and local
  convection becomes more prominent.

## Running to the hills...
- Ambition to set focus on the Scandes mountains; if and how CPM may provide
  added value.
- These figures show changes in snow climate variables (x axes) as a function of
  altitude (y axes), by end-of-C in RCP4.5 and 8.5.
- Solid Precipitation (top left), solid Precipitation/total Precipitation ratio
  (top right), snow cover (bottom left), # days with large snow depth (bottom
  right).

## Orographic precipitation in winter
- Separating windward/leeward model responses in the Scandes indicate systematic
  differences between CPM and RCM.
- If a consistent response it will be an important aspect of expected regional
  climate change in Scandes.
- Further investigation needed.

:::Chapter{headline="Other variables" image="winds.png"}
## Not just precipitation?
- Added value from CPM is evident for precipitation - what about other
  variables?
- We could expect improved representations of winds (e.g. convective wind gusts,
  orographic down-slope wind storms, thermal circulations).

Figures show ongoing work:
- Top panels: PDFs of winter near surface wind speed, comparing CPM (red) and
  RCM (blue) with station values in Sweden (black). Left panel is for low-lying
  stations and right panel for stations in mountains.

In mountains there is clear indication of added value in CPM model, especially
in the tail distribution.

- Bottom figure shows the wind speed as a function of altitude in present
  climate in RCM (blue/green) and CPM (red/purple).

:::Chapter{headline="Summary" image="scandinavia.png"}
## How do we benefit from using CPM models in Fenno-Scandinavia?
- More realistic representation of precipitation, especially in the summer
  season (improvements in frequency, duration and intensity)
- Potential added value through systematically different climate change response
  in heavy summer precipitation.
- Some suggestions of different climate change responses between CPM and RCM in
  solid versus liquid precipitation in the Scandes mountains.
- Near-surface wind speeds are also better represented in the Scandes. Ongoing
  work to investigate potential added value in climate scenarios as well as more
  process based perspectives (e.g. orographic down-slope wind-storms).
