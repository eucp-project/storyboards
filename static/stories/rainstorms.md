## The background and method

The ingredients-based approach for forecasting heavy precipitation (Doswell et
al. 1986) suggests that the amount of precipitation in a location is equal to
the product of average rainfall rate and duration. For a convective storm, the
average rainfall rate is a function of specific humidity (available moisture),
vertical velocity (condensation rate of the moisture), and precipitation
efficiency (fraction of condensed water falling to ground). Local duration
depends on many factors including organization, size and movement of the storm
system, but we focus on the (slower) storm motion only, to maximize local
exposure.

Using 2.2km pan-European simulations for the present (1998-2007) and RCP8.5
future (~2100) simulations, we calculate the co-existence of high moisture
(specific humidity ≥ 10 g kg−1 at 850 hPa) and ascent (vertical velocity ≥ 2 m
s−1 ascent at 700 hPa) with 3-hourly intervals, namely "Extreme Precipitation
Potential" (EPP). Neglecting the effects of highly uncertain precipitation
efficiency, this approximates to hourly precipitation extremes. Adding another
condition for storm motion (Corfidi Vector ≤3 m s−1), we look for "Slow-moving
Extreme Precipitation Potential" (SEPP).

## Extreme Precipitation Potential and Slow-moving Extreme Precipitation Potential in the present and end-of-century (RCP8.5) climates

All of Europe is prone to intense rainstorms as measured by EPP, but the central
Mediterranean experiences the highest frequency of cases, both currently and in
the future. In contrast, All of Europe is prone to intense rainstorms as
measured by EPP, and these are 7.4x more frequent by the end of century (from
∼24 per 100×100km area in the present climate to ~175 in the future). On the
other hand, the slow-moving ones, i.e. SEPPs are relatively rare in the current
climate but become widespread across the continent by 2100, with a 10.6x figure
(changing from ~0.7 to 7.2 per 100×100km area).

In concert with these increases, the number of events with precipitation ≥100 mm
h−1 (about 20% of EPPs in the current climate) increases threefold, while ≥150
mm h−1 is experienced 4× more frequently, and 200 mm h−1 5.2× more frequently by
2100.

## Monthly distribution

Both EPP and SEPP peaks in the late summer and early autumn, with land areas
more towards the summer and sea areas to autumn. Changes over the land are more
pronounced compared to the sea. Currently, 52% of EPP cases occur over land; by
2100 this jumps to 61%, with increases in land (sea) EPP frequencies of 8.6×
(6×) respectively. SEPPs occur relatively equally over land (48%) and sea (52%)
in the current climate but an enormous increase in land SEPPs (14.3×), with a
smaller, but still significant, increase in sea SEPPs (7.3×) increases the land
fraction to 65% by 2100.

## Tracking results from model data

Running a precipitation-tracking algorithm on re-gridded hourly precipitation
output from the model, precipitation areas with at least one 12 km grid point
with ≥20 mmh−1 are detected and the movement speed distribution of such storms
are analyzed. The frequency of such storms robustly increases in the future.

Similar to SEPPs, slow-moving storm systems (≤3 ms−1) analyzed with this
approach are most frequent in autumn in the current climate, but become much
more frequent, with a frequency increase higher than that of faster-moving
systems, in the future. Furthermore, storm speed distributions in all seasons
become skewed to the left; and are thus slower on average year-round.

## Change in components

The large increase in EPPs stems mainly from the moisture ingredient, with a
dramatic increase of cases with q ≥ 10 gkg−1 in all months, while projected w ≥
2 ms−1 cases are higher only from June to September. By 2100, the CPM projects
29× more cases with very moist environments (exceeding the q threshold) than for
the current climate. The average q increases by ∼35%. The moistest environment
is found in August (5.42 g kg−1 for current climate, increasing to 7.26 g kg−1
by 2100), but change in q peaks in November with a 51% increase. By 2100, the
CPM projects 29× more cases with very moist environments (exceeding the q
threshold) than for the current climate.

By 2100, there is higher frequency of slow-storm environments, except during
February-April, with the annual number of slow-moving storms projected to
increase by 20%. We find the largest increases in August-November, ranging from
31% to 65%, and peaking in September. Since this coincides with the peak
exceedance months of thermodynamic thresholds, the kinematic environment of
these high accumulation storms also contributes to, and enhances, the extreme
precipitation rate for a given locality, resulting in an almost 11-fold increase
in SEPPs compared to a 7.4-fold increase in EPPs by 2100.

## Hourly precipitation extremes and storm motion

A comparison of the maximum hourly precipitation around EPP cases versus the
Corfidi Vector magnitude shows a negative relationship for both the current and
future climate simulations. Clearly, the extreme values of maximum accumulated
hourly precipitation occur with slower storm motions. The PDF distribution of
the Corfidi Vector magnitude for all EPPs vs EPPs with 150 mm or higher hourly
precipitation around them also agrees with this statement. Here, the shift of
the peak towards slower storm motion is also evident for the future climate.

:::Chapter{headline="Relative humidity" image="humidity.png"}
## Relative humidity in the mid-troposphere

Although we exclude the precipitation efficiency factor, we have processed an
analysis of mid-tropospheric relative humidity to investigate one of the main
contributing parameters to precipitation efficiency. The average relative
humidity for the whole domain at the 500 hPa level is seasonally variable, with
lower values in the warm season for both current and future climates. The future
simulation shows decreases in relative humidity, with differences compared to
the current climate simulation highest in the spring. The decrease is more
limited in August, September and October, which corresponds to our high season
for EPP and SEPP cases.

For both current and future simulations, extremely high hourly precipitation
amounts occur exclusively within high relative humidity environments; which
validates the role of environmental relative humidity in terms of precipitation
efficiency.

## Conclusion

This study uses a novel method to examine changes to the ingredients of heavy
precipitation. Our results suggest that storms will have higher peak intensity,
longer duration and will be more frequent across the whole of Europe. Current
storms already produce a large number of flash floods, with their potential
impact depending on land use, terrain slope, drainage, and other factors. SEPP
increases would significantly increase this flash flood potential, as an MCS
would be more likely to "stagnate" on a locality, exposing it to extreme
precipitation of longer duration.

Additionally, storm system movement is associated with upper level winds and,
hence, large-scale dynamics. This may increase fluvial flood risk through
consecutive events in one favorable synoptic setting spanning days or more;
blocking is also favored by large-scale meandering patterns associated with
slower flows.

Understanding the underlying ingredients for heavy precipitation change is
crucial from an impacts perspective, helping to discriminate controlling
factors, which have wider applicability beyond those for a single accumulation
period, and to identify the reliability of projected changes. This suggests that
future studies should focus on precipitation accumulations over space and time.
