## Background information

- Climate adaptation strategies require accurate and reliable information about
  future climate evolution.

- Part of this information is obtained from climate projections. However, these
  projections carry a certain degree of uncertainty.

- Uncertainties are generally stemming from the chosen forcing scenario and
  climate model, and the phasing of internal variability.

  This latter is the main uncertainty source in the first decades of the
  projections. As near-term projections can provide valuable information
  needed for a wide range of users across climate-related sectors, there are
  scientific efforts to reduce this uncertainty. Decadal predictions aim thus
  to constrain this internal variability.

- To achieve reduction on uncertainty there are two complementary approaches:
  constraining projections based on decadal predictions and constraining
  projections based on observations.

## Approach for constraining decadal variability

This EUCP scientific output offers an approach to constrain large ensemble
climate projections based on their agreement with initialized decadal
predictions over the common period. This methodology works similarly as
initialized predictions: specifically, it phases in the projection’s own climate
variability with the decadal predictions initialised towards the observed
climate state. The added value of this approach is that it yields climate change
information with a reduced overall uncertainty for the next several decades, as
it addresses the part of the uncertainty derived from internal variability.

## Materials and methods

- Ensemble of climate projections (40 members, 1920-2100, “UNINIT40”), which
  uses radiative forcings from the representative concentration pathway 8.5
  (RCP8.5)

- Retrospective decadal predictions (40 members), which uses historical CMIP5
  external radiative forcings until 2005, and radiative forcings from RCP8.5 for
  2006 onwards.

- Observed sea surface temperature (SST) data from the Met Office Hadley
  Centre's sea ice and sea surface temperature for evaluating large-scale SST
  indices

- Constraining protocol consists on selecting the climate projection ensemble
  members better aligned with the variability of the initialized predictions
  (Best10)

- The figure shows the large ensemble sub-selection methodology. The selection
  procedure is based on pattern correlations of the decadal prediction ensemble
  mean SST anomalies (green circle) with the corresponding SST anomalies of the
  individual members of the (uninitialized) projections (blue).

## Main results

- Skilful near-term projections of ocean temperature indices: the ACC and RMSSS
  metrics (anomaly correlation and root mean square skill score) show high and
  significant skill for the first 10 and 20 forecast years for forecasting the
  GMSST and two (multi-)decadal internal climate variability modes (AMV and
  IPO).

- Regionally improved temperatures projections: there is an added value of the
  global pattern constraint, as the results show significant positive residual
  correlations in some areas in which decadal (unconstrained) projections had
  been previously underperforming (e.g., northern Africa, Southern and Southeast
  Asia, for ACC, and North Atlantic and the tropical Atlantic as well as Indian
  Oceans for RMSS, for instance). The SOE values larger than 1 show in which
  regions the Best10 ensemble is underconfident or overconfident, the other one
  would accordingly be smaller than 1. The figure displays these results.

## Main results

- Providing improved climate estimates of the near future: the Best10
  projections are improved in comparison to UNINIT40 under certain
  circumstances, as for instance when the skill measures calculated for the
  20-year hindcasts indicate improved skill in Best10 compared to UNINIT40 and
  the projected changes for the next 20 years differ between Best10 and
  UNINIT40. This latter criterion indicates that the constraint leads to
  modified estimates of near-term climate change.

The figure shows how the distribution functions get narrower and emphasises more
the larger values with the constrained ensemble (red lines) versus the
unconstrained ensemble (blue lines).

## Conclusions

This storyboard presents an approach to provide near-term climate change
information of increased accuracy, by combining initialized decadal predictions
with longer-term projections. The proposed approach enables skillful
retrospective 20-year predictions of increased accuracy compared to the large
(unconstrained) ensemble, for hindcasts of large-scale SST indices such as AMV,
and surface air temperatures in several regions. It also shows that projections
constrained by climate predictions can provide different climate change
estimates for the next two decades compared to the large, unconstrained,
ensemble.
