## Sandy beach erosion induced by sea level rise

- Almost 41% of European Union’s population lives near the coast
- Big part of European coastline comprises erodible sandy stretches
- Sea level rise (SLR) will cause shoreline retreat
- Need to identify vulnerable coastal areas to focus adaptation measures
- Large scale coastal erosion assessments can aid in identifying hotspots

## Framework for coastal land loss projections

Global probabilistic sea level rise projections were used under the RCP 4.5 and
RCP 8.5 scenarios. For RCP 8.5, a high-end RCP 8.5 scenario based on IPCC AR5
but with a higher contribution from Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets was used.

Two different maps of the location of sandy beaches and two different approaches
for their nearshore slopes are used to account for epistemic input data
uncertainty.

Shoreline retreat is projected in the feature at sandy beach locations on 1 km
alongshore grid around the European coastline.

Sandy beach land loss is calculated by aggregating the total shoreline retreat
per NUTS3 region.

## Shoreline retreat in Europe

Using satellite derived sandy beach locations and spatially varying nearshore
slopes data, projections of shoreline retreat are made.

A European averaged median shoreline retreat of 31 m (22 m) is projected under
RCP 8.5 (4.5) by year 2050, relative to the baseline year 2010.

These values change to 97 m (54 m) under RCP 8.5 (4.5) by year 2100.

Spatial variability along the European coastline is pronounced depending on the
nearshore slopes variability.

This retreat would translate to 2,500 km<sup>2</sup> (1,400 km<sup>2</sup>) of
coastal land loss by 2100.

## Coastal land-loss at European regions scale

Aggregating the projected shoreline retreat per NUTS3 region and normalizing by
the region’s coastline length, helps to identify erosion hotspots around the
European coastline

Highly vulnerable regions are identified on the
- Italian Adriatic coast
- the French Atlantic coast
- Belgium
- The Netherlands
- Denmark
- Lithuania
- Latvia

## Uncertainty analysis

A variance-based sensitivity analysis was used to quantify the uncertainty of
the coastal land loss estimates. This method measures the contribution of each
of the uncertain input parameters; 1) nearshore slope data, 2) sandy beach
location data, 3) RCP scenario, 4) Sea level rise (SLR).

This allows for quantifying and comparing the uncertainties related to the
choice of input geophysical datasets (epistemic) versus the inherent uncertainty
associated with RCPs and SLR projections.

On average epistemic uncertainty accounts for 45% (26%) by 2050 (2100), with
high variability between countries

This provides insights on areas that geophysical datasets should be updated with
monitoring and observations.
