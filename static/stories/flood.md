## The Copenhagen flood of 2011
In the evening on July 2, 2011 a severe cloudburst occurred over Copenhagen,
Denmark. Between 90 and 135 mm of precipitation was recorded in less than 2
hours, which flooded the city and caused hundreds of millions of Euros in
insured damages.

The animation depicts the evolution of the radar reflectivity of the event.

## Simulating intense convective storms
Simulating an intense convective storm is very challenging due, among other
things, to a very high sensitivity to initial conditions and a general
difficulty of the models to resolve small-scale interactions. Here, we use a
sophisticated ensemble approach with the HARMONIE-AROME limited-area numerical
weather prediction model to represent the event.

The figure shows the hourly precipitation at 16 UTC for all ensemble 13 members
(a,d-o), a calculated risk of exceeding a threshold of 60 mm/h (b) and the
associated ensemble mean (c). The red star indicates the location of Copenhagen.

## Risk assessment
Our approach indicates that we have been able to catch the main characteristics
of the storm and hence assessing a related risk of exceeding certain
precipitation intensity thresholds. The next objective is to better understand
the influence on the event from due to overall global warming  and projected
further future warming levels.

Using an adapted pseudo-global warming approach, we investigate the related risk
of exceedance of the same event using conditions mimicking pre-industrial
conditions, But also to analyse the related risk of the event using conditions
mimicking different future warming levels.

The figure shows maps of the calculated risk of exceeding a threshold of 60 mm/h
between 15 UTC and 20 UTC for all warming levels (-1째C, control, +1째C, +2째C and
+3째C respectively).

## Take home messages
- The Harmonie CP NWP model can capture the nature of the extreme Copenhagen
  event of July 2, 2011
- While it is not necessarily possible to simulate the Copenhagen extreme event
  with perfection, it is possible to capture the possible severity and a
  reasonably accurate location when taking an ensemble approach.
- The risk of achieving precipitation amounts such as those observed has
  increased due to global warming.
- The risk of achieving even more intense precipitation rates over the affected
  region increases with further warming.
