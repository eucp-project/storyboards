## Co-production of storylines for applications
Here we present the steps and outcomes which emerged when creating a draft
climate storylines product for the heritage sector, in particular Historic
Environment Scotland in the UK. This case study investigates the intersection of
storylines as a scientific process with storylines as a user product.

This example adds to the growing body of publications on the concept of
storylines in climate science and services by providing an example directly
involving stakeholders throughout. This aimed to explore the role of storylines
including physical drivers in the information production process, as well as
storylines as a user product to communicate the information.

This flowchart outlines the potential steps for producing storylines for a
particular application, with direct stakeholder input at various stages.

The key features to include and test during the process are:

* A clear decision or planning context that the storylines will inform
* Characterisation of events and future changes using physical drivers
* Characterisation of the full range of uncertainty in the chosen hazard metrics
* Reduction of the uncertainty range to what is ‘application relevant’
* Testing ways of providing this to the stakeholder

## Establishing the application context
The cultural and built heritage sector is clearly exposed to weather hazards
which are evolving under climate change and is responsible for enabling the
preservation and enjoyment of an invaluable and non-renewable resource covering
natural landscapes, managed buildings and collections and ancient monuments. The
degree to which current sites, assets and operations are resilient to these
changes is currently being explored in the literature.

Following initial conversations with Historic Environment Scotland (HES) on
climate change information needs and related decisions in the organisation, it
was clear there would not be the opportunity to test the utility of example
climate storylines on decisions directly yet.

However, the potential usefulness and usability could still be explored with a
climate change team member who would further disseminate such information within
the organisation. This was done via the production of information from which to
create trial storylines, and an example of how this may be provided to HES, with
uses from communication and awareness raising to starting to bring consideration
of future hazards into planning and decision making.

## Focus-group/workshop participants
Alongside dialogue with the main stakeholder we also gathered feedback from
heritage management professionals, academics or climate service providers
working on related projects from around Europe. These organisations are listed
on the left.

While this feedback was provided feedback at the later stages of the production,
it is useful to consider the wider view points and potential applications,
adding to the perspectives provided by HES. These included the hazards of
interest, exposed heritage and current uses of climate information, as well as
direct feedback on example storylines.

## Analysing the observations and projections
The analysis comprised of several steps using observations, reanalysis data and
projections.

**Metric and climate data selection**: Selection of data sources, and hazard metrics
of interest to address the user needs. A key point was to explore possibilities
using existing projection products.

**Climate driver analysis**: An operational Meteorology tool, the Met Office
European weather patterns, were used to look at the drivers of events and
seasons of interest.

**Bias and plausibility checks**: Understanding how well climate projections
represent variables, metrics and physical processes of interest.

**Characterisation of future change**: The driver information was used to decompose
future changes into dynamic and thermodynamic components, highlighting changes
and uncertainty due to warming and circulation. Observations were used to put
the future changes in context.

## Establishing the application relevance

**Information selection**: Since the relevant uncertainty needed to be established,
future storylines were created from high, median and low ensembles members for
each hazard independently. Tables of information were also produced to show the
full uncertainty range across regions and different ways of measuring the
hazard.

**Example products**: an example communication product was produced, aiming to
provide tiered information from headline messages to the scientific background.
This resulted in a flexible set of information which could be disseminated in
stakeholder organisations in various ways.

**Testing & feedback**: The information generated, and example product, was
discussed with HES and the focus group. Feedback was provided on the specific
format and information, as well as more generally on the concept of storylines.

## User review of draft products
Here we show some quotes and key points we have determined during the
stakeholder engagement process. These cover the format and content, inclusion of
uncertainty and potential applications.

Some overall key findings are that:

* Storylines provided a useful framing for discussing & communicating
  uncertainty, deciding on the **'relevant uncertainty'** brings out application
  characteristics such as **risk appetite and uncertainty budget**

* **Specific examples are key to enable this dialogue** ('storyline' has many
  meanings within climate science and services and outside), this contrasted
  against a hope of allowing the storylines to emerge organically

* There is an appetite for more scientific information to be provided to a range
  of users, such as the weather pattern information

* There are many potential benefits are not unique to a storylines approach,
  some of which were:

  * Making uncertainty tangible and relevant to people and place
  * Provide a physical basis for events and changes, linking the past and
    future, and bringing together multiple data sources on multiple timescales
  * The potential to focus on an application relevance decision, or potential
    reactions (e.g. adaptation measures, not covered here but **climate is not
    the only variable to account for**)
