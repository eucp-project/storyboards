## Multiple lines of evidence
Users of climate information now have many sources of climate data to choose
from.

The different sources have different characteristics such as resolution which
means that some sources are better suited to particular applications.

However, the different datasets sample different sources of uncertainty and
therefore will offer different uncertainty ranges.

Although high resolution data (e.g. from convection permitting models) is often
preferred by users, the number of model simulations available is often limited
compared to lower resolution simulations.

Can information from other data sources, or lines of evidence, be used to better
inform the interpretations of results from impact studies?

## Multiple lines of evidence
**EUCP is trying to help users by assembling data from across different datasets
for common regions and providing guidance on interpreting those differences.**

This is important because looking across the different datasets provide really
important context for interpreting results based on a particularly dataset.

**The following case study shows how this might look in practice.**

## Example case study: Landslide risk in Romania
Landslides are a common hazard in Romania with impacts on property and
infrastructure. Rainfall is a key triggering factor in landslide events and
there is interest around how landslide risk in the future will change under
different climate projections.

## Recent research into future climate changes and their impact on landslide risk.

North-Eastern Romania. Climate Change Management, (May),
245-265.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37425-9_13)

This study finds that climate projections imply a return to higher rainfall
intensities that were last seen in the 1970s  and 1980s and which coincided with
increased landslide events.

However, the study is based on a subset of the CORDEX multi-model ensemble,
consisting of just 10 models.

Can further information that puts these models in the context of the wider
CORDEX ensemble, as well as other climate model ensembles, help with
interpreting the results of this study?

## Examining the information from multiple lines of evidence
By visualising data from other sources of climate projections, it is possible to
interpret the results of the study in a wider context and gain greater
information about the uncertainties involved in interpreting the results.

Each point in the figure represents the % change in the multi annual mean of JJA
(June, July, August) of precipitation in Romania from the period 1996-2005 to
2041-2050.

Separating out the models used as drivers for downscaling helps with
understanding how representative the driving models are of the wider ensemble,
but further analysis is useful for understanding the impact downscaling itself…

:::Chapter{headline="Impact of dynamical downscaling" image="impact.png"}
## Impact of dynamical downscaling
The impact of downscaling the CMIP5 models is mixed, causing both increases and
decreases in the precipitation change signal relative to the driving GCM
depending on the RCM used. The variance is more positively skewed though, with
larger changes on the wetter side. Choosing other CMIP5 models to downscale
could conceivably produce wetter or drier results than the existing CORDEX
range.

For the two EUCP CPM models, the impact of downscaling the driving CORDEX models
gives either a similar or a wetter result compared to the driving model.

## Summary
Examining results from multiple lines of evidence makes it easier to put the
results of a study in context.

In this example, information suggests that the models used in the study are a
reasonable representation of the most likely outcomes indicated by most other
lines of evidence.

However, there is a significant tail risk of a drier future outcome than
suggested by the models used in the study. There is also a less likely tail risk
of wetter outcomes.
