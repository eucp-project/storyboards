## Background

Many different methods exist to quantify and constrain projections of future
climate, differing in both their evaluation against observed changes and their
underlying methodological assumptions.

In order to investigate if different methods agree with each other, a
coordinated testing framework is needed. Otherwise, method results reported in
the scientific literature are often not comparable because they differ not only
in their approach (which we want to analyse) but also in their setup such as:

* variable (e.g., temperature vs precipitation)
* region (e.g., global vs Europe)
* season (e.g., annual vs summer)
* time period (e.g., 2041-2060 vs 2080-2099)
* type of change (e.g., absolute vs relative change)
* models used (including ensemble members used)
* uncertainties included (e.g., internal variability vs forced response only)
* reported results (e.g., likely vs interquartile range)

## A common framework for method comparison
Within EUCP we brought together 8 groups working on quantifying uncertainty in
future climate projections and developed a common framework to enable a fair
comparison:

* temperature and precipitation
* Europe, SREX regions, 4 grid points
* summer (June, July, August)
* change in 2041-60 relative to 1995-2014
* CMIP5 models under RCP8.5
* same model pool (if possible)
* including 20-year internal variability
* median, 50%, and 80% range
* 2.5x2.5 horizontal resolution
* ocean masked using grid cell center

## Central European summer temperature change

* Most methods show a slightly lower median warming than in the unconstrained
  case
* Most methods show a reduction in spread
* Some divergence in the constrained distributions from the different methods
  (see next panel)
* Also the unconstrained distributions differ  (common model pool **not** used
  here)

## Central European summer temperature change: using the same model pool

* Using the same model pool reduces differences in the unconstrained
  distribution to a minimum. Remaining difference for HistC:
    1. calculation of percentiles (empirically vs Gaussian)
    2. slightly different handling of internal variability
* Methods consistently narrow the uncertainty range and agree on slightly less warming

## Remaining differences in the underlying method properties
There are remaining differences in the underlying method properties. See the
table in the left.

## Conclusions and outlook
* A common testing framework allows to consistently compare constrained
  projections from several different methods
* Methods agree on several aspects but disagree on others
* Agreement depends on the target (variable, region, mean/extreme changes)
* Some divergence in the constrained projections from different methods is
  expected due to differences in their underlying properties

- How can we choose between methods (if they disagree)?
    1. Considering the decision context (mean or extreme changes important?)
    2. Combining different methods (e.g., Hegerl et al. 2021)
    3. Selecting methods based on an objective skill measure (e.g., Oâ€™Reilly et
    al. in preparation)
