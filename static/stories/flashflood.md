## Introduction and Aim: EUCP data

### WP3 simulations with high-resolution convection-permitting regional climate models

- Better representation of extreme rainfall (Ban et al., 2021)
- Heavy to severe rainfall would happen more often in the future (Pichelli et
  al., 2021)

### So what would this mean?

Translate high-resolution convection-permitting climate models to hydrological
impacts

## Introduction and Aim: Flash floods in the Alps

- Dangerous fast sudden floods
- Triggered by extreme local rainstorms
- Very deadly!

### Question
- If extreme rainfall changes, how will this affect flash flood risks?

## Methodology
Simulate high-resolution distributed hydrological model for 4 periods:

- validation: ERA5
- historical climate: climate model ERA-Interim 2000-2012
- current climate: climate model 1998-2007
- future climate: climate model 2095-2105
:::

:::Chapter{headline="Results-simulation" image="simulation.png"}
## Results

- Hydrological model plus climate model perform reasonable.
- Able to simulate recorded historical flash floods in the modelling domain.

driven simulations at Bellinzona station on the Ticino.

## Results
- Kling-Gupta efficiency for 130 gauging stations in the modelled domain for the
  ERA-Interim driven simulation. Assessment period 2002-2012 for daily
  discharges.

Rhine at Basel: KGE 0.62

Model chain of ERA-Interim driven convection-permitting climate model and
distributed hydrological model gives reasonable performance. Recorded flash
floods from databases are reproduced in the modelling results (not shown).

## Results - Contrasting response summer and autumn - frequency

- Adapted definition of [Amponsah et al
  (2018)](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1783-2018) for flash floods:
  - Maximal size of affected 3000 km2
  - Peak specific discharge is at least 0.5 m3s-1km-2 discharge divided by
    upstream area

## Results - Contrasting response summer and autumn - intensity

Magnitudes of peak specific discharge for the catchments when threshold for
flash flood is reached.

- Boxplot: 25th, 50th and 75th percentile
- Whiskers: 2.5th and 97.5th percentile
- Diamonds: maximum

## Conclusions and Future work
- Frequency decrease in summer, but more severe extremes
- Frequency increase in autumn with more severe extremes
- Ensemble study
