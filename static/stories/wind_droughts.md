## Introduction

The decline of wind speed in some regions of the world is expected to decrease
wind power production.

As the occurrence of wind drought receives increasing attention, two questions
should be discussed.

1. Will the decrease in wind energy resources continue in the future?
2. Are the current "wind energy drought" caused by climate change?

**Aim**: Systematic attribution work of wind power production in Europe.

## Data and Methods

Datasets used in this project are:

- ERA5 forecast dataset:
  - 10m wind speed (w10), w100, 2m temperature (t2m), 850hPa temperature (850t)
- Model simulation:
  - 10 models from EURO-CORDEX ensemble, variables including: w10, t2m, 850t.
    Machine Learning method was used to get the w100 from 10 model ensembles.
- Mast stations


**Load factor** - the ratio of average electrical power to the rated electrical
power, is used to characterize wind energy.

## Wind drought in the Whole Europe

The figure shows the changes in return periods and return values for 10 model
ensembles in three different periods.

-> Previous:1971-2000

-> Current: 2000-2029

-> Future: 2041-2069

**For Whole Europe**, the low wind energy winter becomes more frequent in the
recent year and the increase will be continue in the future. During 2041-2070,
the risk ratio is about 1.52, which implies that the probability that the load
factor is lower than the threshold would be increased in the future climate, and
it would be more than 1.52 times as much as that in the current climate.

**In Britanny**, changes of wind energy drought are not significant during three
different periods.

## Wind energy drought in different countries

The figure shows the risk ratios in each country during different climate
periods.

When the risk ratio >1, the low wind energy events are more frequent compared
with the earlier climate period.

Most countries are experiencing more frequent low wind energy events compared
with the previous period. In the future, low wind energy events will become more
common in most countries, especially in northern countries where wind energy
drought will occur more frequently.

## Wind energy drought in a warming world

The figure shows the return periods for model ensemble under 1.5, 2, and 3â„ƒ
global warming scenarios. The 5% and 95% of the medians show the uncertainty
interval.

The changes of low wind energy in Europe are particularly vulnerable to climate
change, experience adverse effect of global warming in the whole Europe. With
global warming, low wind energy winter in Europe occur more frequently.

## General conclusion

- Whole Europe:

  Low wind energy winter in Europe is expected to become more common in a
  warming world. The return period of 11 years return period events have been
  shortened to about 10 years in the whole Europe and it would be shortened to
  about 7 years during 2041-2070 under RCP 8.5 scenarios.

- Regional differences:

  Low wind energy winter are becoming more common in most countries from the
  past to the current, and it will become more frequent in the future,
  particularly in northern countries, which would have a negative impact on the
  development of wind power generation in these regions.
