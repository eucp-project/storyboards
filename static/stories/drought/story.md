## (Some) advantages of large ensemble simulations

- **Large ensembles** are many realisations of the same climate model
  experiment, the many realisations capture **internal** variability within the
  climate system (Deser et al., 2020, NCC).
- Large ensembles thus contain a large diversity of weather events, we can use
  this to **select events** and **investigate drivers or changes** (Van der Wiel
  et al., 2020, ERL).

## (Some) advantages of storylines

- People are very well trained in listening to and understanding stories. Just
  think: "Once upon a timeâ€¦".
- **Storylines** improve risk awareness and decision-making processes. This is
  due to their **connection with observed events** and user-focus (Hazeleger et
  al., 2015, NCC; Shepherd et al., 2018, CC).
- In this work we aim to combine the positives of large ensembles and storylines
  to answer societally relevant questions.

## Proposed methodology

Two step process:

1. Select simulated events like the observed event: 'analogues'
1. Compare the analogues in present and future climates

To verify the quality of the results, we have to consider:

- How to define the observed event, how to select analogues?
- Are there analogues that resemble the observed event?
- Does this provide robust and reliable climate change information?

In the remainder of this storyboard we provide a **proof-of-concept**, creating
storylines of **future European drought events like 2018**.

## Selection of simulated analogues

- We define metrics that describes (part of) the event of interest, this is done
  by choosing a variable and its spatial and temporal properties.
- Using this event definition, we select simulated events from the large
  ensemble dataset by means of maximum similarity.
- In the case study we used three event metrics, metric 1 is shown here. Twenty
  simulated events were selected, each of these with very high August-October
  precipitation deficit as the observed event in 2018. We took the mean over
  these twenty events, and used this composite 'analogue' in the remainder of
  the study.

## Investigation of climate change and analogues

- We compute analogues using three large ensemble datasets, describing
  present-day climate and two future warmer climates (pre-industrial + 2C
  warming and +3C warming).
- These analogues can then be compared to identify the influence of climate
  change on the event of interest. The analogues show what the event might look
  like in a warmer future climate.
- In our case study, we find that **future droughts are more severe**. Lower
  precipitation and higher evapotranspiration lead to **higher future peak
  precipitation deficits**. The exact timing and magnitude of changes are metric
  dependent.

## Conclusions

- The large ensemble storyline method works. It allows to create analogues of
  observed events in future warmer climates.
- The ensemble data set has to be quite bit, this is necessary to find the right
  balance between analogue composite size (to decrease influence of natural
  variability, noise) and analogue return period (to sample an appropriate
  extreme event).
