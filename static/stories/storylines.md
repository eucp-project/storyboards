## Storylines in EUCP

Storylines or narrative approaches to constructing and communicating climate
information is a growing area within climate science and services. In this work,
we broadly define 'storylines' as narrative-based approaches to creating and
communicating **physically based** information about past, current or future
weather and climate, including an exploration of **relevant uncertainty**.

We differentiate storylines as a user product from storylines as a process
(scientific buildings blocks, and lines of evidence assessment). More details
can be found in our deliverable report, and the section annotations on the Venn
diagram describe where different pieces of work sit in this report.

#### We used these opportunistic pieces of work across EUCP to help answer:

1. What are climate storylines and where are they useful?
2. How could storylines bring together various outputs and products of EUCP
   science?
3. What are the challenges of producing them as a service?

Other research outcomes from EUCP may also form the basis for storylines
products in the future, such as decadal predictions and their merging with
projections, spatial merging and statistical downscaling and various methods of
weighting and constraining projections.

## End-to-end storylines for applications
Two case studies were performed where storylines-related information and
products were produced for two sectors in the UK: the heritage management sector
and water resources sector. These aimed to demonstrate that storylines
approaches are an appropriate way to construct and communicate information to
users of climate projections, increasing the usefulness and usability of it.
Direct user feedback was gathered at various stages of the analysis.

On the left, a flow chart for the production of physically based storylines
tailored to a particular application is shown, as well as some details of the
two applications and example images from the analysis.

#### Co-production case study findings & outcomes
* Storylines provided a useful framing for discussing & communicating
  uncertainty, deciding on the '**relevant uncertainty**' brings out application
  characteristics such as **risk appetite and uncertainty budget**

* **Examples are key to enable this dialogue** (storylines has many meanings
  within climate science and services and outside)

* The information on atmospheric drivers can help add a **sense of physical
  plausibility and connection** between the past and future.

Many potential benefits are not unique to a storylines approach, some of which
were:

* Making uncertainty tangible and relevant to people and place
* Providing a physical basis for events and changes, linking the past and future
* The potential to focus on an application relevant decision, or potential
  adaptation actions, **climate is not the only variable to account for**.

## Scientific building blocks

The images represent some of the scientific building blocks of storylines which
emerged from EUCP science.

#### Building blocks findings & outcomes

* Examples of event based storylines were produced (using new event analogues
  and PGW experiments), ready for a discussion of potential application and what
  would be required of a user product.
* Methods for the analysis of variability in projections and predictions were
  explored, with potential for application in sub-selection or looking at
  storylines of enhanced/realistic variability.
* An algorithmic approach to sub-selection with multi-variate metrics was tested
  via 'thought experiment' case studies.

#### Key points
* Intensive analysis is required, including expert elicitation
* Cutting edge science is included, currently untested in user applications
* A Europe- or sector-wide view was not investigated fully, e.g. potential to
  downscale certain 'storylines' for the EUCP CPM MME to provide general
  'storylines'

**Upscaling challenge**: how to reconcile these points with bespoke user
products?

## Lines of evidence tool
On the left example output from the lines of evidence assessment tool is shown.
This provides a summary of information from a range of projections and methods.
This may be used early in the production of storylines for user applications to
inform the selection of data sources and expose the range of uncertainty, or at
the end, to place the information in a wider context.

####  Lines of evidence findings & outcomes

* Data processing overhead prohibits most individual users from looking at
  multiple datasets for a wider uncertainty context. The tool has gathered
  projections from a wide range of products in order to make such information
  accessible to users of projections in Europe to make informed selections.

* The analysis also offers a useful basis for infilling missing parts of the
  uncertainty space in downscaled datasets, either with new dynamical
  downscaling experiments or statistical approaches such as those explored in
  EUCP.

* This could form the basis for a more flexible interactive tool that would
  allow a user to produce a bespoke figure for specific regions, seasons and
  time periods.

## What are climate storylines and where are they useful?

The key points on the left were largely drawn from the two examples of
end-to-end production of storylines for applications, and using this to reflect
on other pieces of EUCP science.

Storylines as a user product, as well as a scientific process, are highly
dependant on the user or science question, and so we do not attempt to define
what they may be comprised of. However, both the application examples as well as
the emerging science have demonstrated their usefulness.

:::Chapter{headline="Findings 2" image=slide6.png}
## How could storylines bring together various output and products of EUCP science?

The key points on the left were largely drawn from work across EUCP which was
not included in the storylines task. However, the examples of storylines for
applications and scientific building blocks helped speculate about how these
elements could come together in the future.

In EUCP these investigations were performed in parallel. Now these examples and
techniques have been developed, we can begin to think about how storylines, or
related concepts, may form part of the climate data value chain in the future:
from informing the production of information to its application in decision
making and planning (see the flow chart on the left).

:::Chapter{headline="Findings 3" image=slide7.png}
## What are the challenges of producing storylines as a service?
The application examples as well as the scientific outcomes all highlighted
challenges to the upscaling of these activities.

There is a clear need for future work to test storylines further in a range of
specific applications, as well as assess the potential for a set of Europe-wide
storylines to form the foundation from which to generate these application
products.

Many applications may require bespoke products. However, exploring which
elements of this can be streamlined may help address the upscaling challenge.
This should be carried out with the understanding that a large part of the value
in storylines as a user product may be in the co-production process and
associated dialogue, rather than the outcome.
